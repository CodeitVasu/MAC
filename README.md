# MAC
Design of a multiply and accumulator function which multiplies a complex 16-bit signed binary signal with its delayed version when summed for multiple iterations.
The system consists of a clock signal, enable and input signal. The testing of the code is done from inputs imported from text files containing 64 16-bit signed binary numbers.
